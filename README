  Plugin for CakePHP


  ---- A CakePHP plugin enabling transfer/manipulation/embedding
       of files in 23 ways.

  Synopsis
  --------
  This plugin was conceived as a thorough solution to all the needs coming from
  dealing with media files in a web application. Moreover the idea was to show
  how much a well maintained plugin can be worth it and inspire others to do the
  same. The plugin slowly evolved (and in fact still does) from a very distinct
  set of tightly coupled components into something much more flexible. This
  allows you to use only the functionality you really need.

  Authors

  See the AUTHORS file.

  Donations
  ---------
  If you enjoy working with this plugin and this open source project is of
  great use to you, consider buying me a book from my amazon wish list.

  Versions & Requirements
  -----------------------
  1.3.0, CakePHP 1.3.x, PHP >=5.2.1 (in progress)
  0.6.x, CakePHP 1.2.x, PHP >=5.1.0
  0.5.x, CakePHP 1.2.x, PHP >=5.1.0

  The plugin is known to run fine under linux and darwin. There exist some
  issues on windows (http://github.com/davidpersson/media/issues#issue/8),
  though.

  With version 1.3.0, the plugin comes bundled with the mm library replacing
  classes related to media processing, metadata and MIME-types. Please see
  the documentation of the mm library (http://github.com/davidpersson/mm)
  for additonal requirements and information.

  Versions prior to 1.3.0 used to follow a different naming scheme. This has
  been changed in retrospect (i.e. 0.6x is now known as 0.6.x) in order to
  make a clean and comprehensible chronology.

  Getting Help
  ------------
  You can post questions regarding the usage of the plugin to the very active
  Official CakePHP Mailinglist (http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php). When
  question are answered there (I try to answer them all) it helps everybody
  reading the list. This is also the reason why I prefer not to answer direct
  support requests through email or other messaging systems.

  Bugs
  ----
  If you've found a bug or would like to suggest a feature, create a ticket in the
  issue tracker. You'll find the tracker at:

  http://github.com/davidpersson/media/issues

  Contributing
  ------------
  If you have some ideas for improving this library just fork the repository,
  make your changes and when ready send a pull request to notify me about the
  changes you made. I'll review them and see if I can merge them back. Please
  style your code according to the code which is already there.

  Please note that code which is supposed to be merged into this (blessed)
  repository must carry the same header (including the copyright statement) as
  all code in the library and should be free of any @author tags. This may seem
  a little strange at first. But let me explain: Multiple copyright
  holders/licenses complicate things where not necessary. @author tags seem to
  mark sections of code as belonging to, owned or claimed by the specific author.

  As an alternative the project has a dedicated AUTHORS file where every contributor
  is listed with her/his name/nick along with an email address.
